    	<p>The last year and a half I’ve been working on completing an MBA. And, as of May 2016, I am the proud recipient of a MBA from Webster University George Herbert Walker School of Business!</p>

<p>When I mentioned to people that I was going to school for a MBA, I would often be asked, “why?” Especially considering that I’m a software developer.</p>

<p>Why I got a MBA.</p>

<p>I initially got the idea to purse a graduate degree to be competitive for promotions when I was in the military. I decided on a MBA because my undergrad was in Information Systems Technology and I really wanted to do something different. Actually, I could have got a MA in Information Technology in about half the time using credit I had received for advanced training in the military, but thought the MBA was more widely applicable and thus more beneficial in the long run.</p>

<p>Another reason, I figured it would be helpful landing my dream job of becoming a CIO or some kind of C-level executive in IT. This was not just wishful thinking either. Based on research I had done and from what I new of other successful CIOs, getting some proper business acumen under my belt was extremely important.</p>

<p>And finally, another reason was to obtain the knowledge and credentials to start my own business one day. A MBA is by no means necessary, but the business acumen is very important (for me anyway). This is especially true when it comes to financing.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is why I got a MBA. It was a lot of hard work, but very gratifying in the end. I’m glad I did it.</p>
