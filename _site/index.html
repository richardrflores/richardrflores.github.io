      <p>In a previous post on <a href="http://richardrflores.com/2017/05/08/event-sourcing.html">event sourcing</a>, I mentioned that there should be a compelling business need to use event sourcing, but how do we know it’s a suitable pattern? After talking to several colleagues I was introduced to the idea of thinking in event streams in order to figure out if event sourcing would be an appropriate given a new new project or adding to an existing solution. Jimmy Bogard commented on <a href="https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2015/05/26/event-sourcing-revisited/">Event Sourcing Revisted</a> by Gabriel Schekner, in response to this same question. His process is to determine whether the business (not the developers) thinks and models their problem as a series of events, as a way of deciding to use an event sourced system. If we’re lucky the business will think about and actually model their system as a series of events. They might recognize events in their domain, but I don’t think it’s likely they would have the technical expertise to model the system as a stream of events without input from technical experts familiar with design of event based systems. So it’s up to us, not only be able to recognize events in the domain, but to transform those thoughts into event streams. So how do we get there? We need to start thinking in event streams!</p>

      <p>I recently took an interest in CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to learn how it’s used with DDD (Domain Driven Design) for a project I’m working on. CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates a system into two distinct parts, which either changes the state of the system or reads its current state. While on my CQRS journey, I came across several articles and posts which covered Event Sourcing (ES). This was really interesting to me so went in a little deeper to get a better understanding. Here’s what I know.</p>

RequireJS allows us to encapsulate code into a useful units (modules) and manage the dependencies to other units of javascript code. KnockoutJS is an open source javascript library for creating dynamic UIs. KnockoutJS uses the Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern to provide binding and dependency tracking between client side data models and the UI.</p>

      <p>How does a request for a URL become HTML in an ASP.NET MVC application? This information can be easily found by doing a basic search for the ASP.NET http request cycle. This process is pretty well documented, on both <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd381612(v=vs.100).aspx">MSDN</a> and the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-5/lifecycle-of-an-aspnet-mvc-5-application">ASP.NET website</a>, so I recommend you go there for a more detailed explanation of the process.

      <p>About a month or so ago, on a trip to a conference, during dinner, my colleagues and I had a conversation around the use of mocks in unit testing. Not surprisingly it was a passionate conversation on the premise that mocks are bad and should be avoided because it can lead to poor testing form and ultimately sub-optimal design. The conversation was not only entertaining but very interesting, so I took some time to look into it further and form my own opinions.</p>

      <p>Over the past few months I’ve had to coach some junior developers on how to TDD. Although most of the devs I’ve been working with are knowledgeable about TDD, putting it to practice seems to be a challenge. Most of them know how to write unit tests, but are not actually practicing TDD where the development of tests drives the development of the code. Instead, they are writing the code first and then bolting tests on afterward. Although this approach works, it is not TDD; it’s unit testing. And unfortunately, misses the main benefit of TDD which is to write testable code that adheres to SOLID design principles; in particular Interface Segregation and Dependency Injection.</p>
