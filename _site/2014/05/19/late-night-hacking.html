    	<p>My first post using jekyll static website template and GitHub Pages!</p>

<p>So!? What’s the big deal!? Nothing really. I started blogging a few years ago as means of capturing my thoughts and experiences getting back into software development after a 3 year hiatus. Honestly, I was so busy with work, family and improving my skills in whatever spare time I had, that I was not really active the first year. The following year I set a goal to at least write four blog posts; one per quarter. I actually exceeded my goal and wrote 6 posts. This year my goal was to write at least one post a month. I know, not very ambitious, but I’m being realistic with my commitments and obligations, so I think its a worthy goal.</p>

<p>Ok. Back to using jekyll and GitHub Pages. Why? Well my first site was with WordPress. WordPress is pretty awesome. It has a ton of features and you can get up and running very quickly; however, I was never able to find a theme I really liked and I spent way more time than I wanted to, trying to customize the themes I had. I also didn’t want to pay for hosting anymore. So I decided to cancel my hosting and started up a free blog using Blogger. Blogger has a lot of cool features too, but I didn’t like the themes that were available and really wanted to try something different.</p>

<p>I had heard about people using static website templates like jekyll and Octopress and the hacky nature of them and I was also aware that you could host a site on GitHub for free using these static website templates, so I was interested in trying it out. So here I am, writing my first post on my new blog site hosted on GitHub.</p>

<p>So far so good. I really like how I was able to quickly and easily setup the site with the look and feel I wanted. I also think its pretty awesome that I’m using html to write my posts and git to publish them. I’m a terrible speller, so spell check is something I’m seriously missing. For now, I’ll use word to write my posts and paste in. I’m not sure if there is anything I can do about that. Maybe there is a plug-in I could install on jekyll or in Sublime.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Sublime does support spell-check out of the box. On OSx it uses a standard US dictionary and is off by default. The keyboard shortcut is ‘F6’.</p>
